This code has two options: Landscapes, 4-Image Stories. 
Landscapes will show one large landscape image, there are currently 8 that are selected randomly. You will not get the same image twice in a row.
4-Image Stories shows 4 images in chronological order, there are currently 6 sets of images. You will not get the same set twice in a row.

The idea is to use this to prompt students to: infer characters thoughts and feelings, predict what happens next, use good langauge to describe an environment, or as a basis for a short story of their own.
