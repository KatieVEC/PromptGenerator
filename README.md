# Prompt Generator

This code currently has two options: Landscapes, 4-Image Stories. 

Landscapes will show one large landscape image, there are currently 38 that are selected at random. More images will come after the stories have been completed. You will not get the same image twice in a row.

4-Image Stories shows 4 images in chronological order, there are currently 14 sets of images that are selected at random. More image sets are in the works. You will not get the same set twice in a row.

The idea is to use this to prompt students to: infer characters thoughts and feelings, predict what happens next, use good langauge to describe an environment, or as a basis for a short story of their own. It can also be used for children who find writing difficult to dictate their answers to the above ideas, removing the fear of reading/writing while demonstrating/evidencing the inference and prediction skills.
